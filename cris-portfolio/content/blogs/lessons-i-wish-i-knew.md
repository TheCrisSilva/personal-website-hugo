There is an ongoing debate in every corner of offline and online societies about whether to pursue a traditional education, which is going to university after high school or developing a skill.

The traditional education system follows a one-size-fits-all model, leading to an outdated curriculum and the possibility of unused valuable information. However, it does help students become organised, and work with each other efficiently and effectively, those valuable qualities in the professional world. On the other hand, the skill route offers quicker and more focused growth, but it is also subjective to the skill a person wants to develop.

A balanced approach where both traditional education and skill development can be pursued is the ideal solution. 

By combining both advantages, individuals can gain a solid foundation and specialised knowledge in their chosen field, making them well-rounded and in high demand for potential employers.

Here are my steps to get the best of both worlds.

1. Learn the basics of the field thoroughly. Revisit them from time to time, and it's important to understand the fundamentals. Remember, while there may be many ways to approach a task, it's essential to have a strong grasp of the fundamental concepts. You can start by watching tutorials and building projects, but without a solid understanding of the underlying concepts, you may struggle when it comes to solving problems and troubleshooting

2. Start taking challenges you can handle. Find a project that you can work on at your own pace and stick with it. Building things will help you develop the habit of creating, which will provide a deeper understanding of the subject.

3. find a community or build your own tribe. Join a community that supports your goals. Surround yourself with positive and supportive individuals who can provide technical or emotional support. Building exceptional skills requires dedication and focus, so it's important to minimize negative influences in your life.


4. Establish consistency in your work. Allocate specific time for your projects and stick to it. Cultivate the habit of consistency, as it is a key aspect of becoming a lifelong learner. Continuously engage in learning and developing skills throughout your life.

5. Consider enrolling in a traditional educational program or taking courses that complement your skill development. This can help provide a structured learning experience and offer opportunities to connect with others in the same field.

6. Keep learning and evolving. Science and technology are constantly changing and evolving, and it's essential to stay up to date with the latest developments. Attend conferences, workshops, and seminars to learn from experts and make connections.

7. Balance is key. Pursuing both traditional education and skill development can be time-consuming, so it's important to find a balance that works for you. Allocating time for both and prioritising your goals can help ensure you are making the most of both paths.

Remember, the goal is to be well-rounded and knowledgeable in your field, and by following these steps, you can achieve the best of both worlds!
